Design software for the broadest audience, including non-experts, to make AI technologies easy to use with minimal effort. Hide complex details behind simple, high-level APIs so users can perform tasks without understanding intricate internals. Provide clear, comprehensive documentation with executable examples and tutorials, treating documentation as the primary user interface. Participate in and advocate for open standards in data formats, model representations, and protocols to support an interoperable AI ecosystem. Create interchangeable components, such as models, tokenizers, and feature extractors, to allow flexibility. Use standardized method names and signatures, like from_pretrained, generate, save_pretrained, and forward, for consistent functionality. Assign each component a single, well-defined responsibility, such as Config for parameters, Model for computation, and Tokenizer for text processing. Offer mechanisms like AutoModel and AutoTokenizer to automatically select the correct class based on identifiers or context, simplifying workflows. Ensure configuration objects, like Config, are serializable to JSON, shareable, and include all metadata needed for reproducibility and model loading. Set well-chosen default parameters to enable immediate use without extensive setup. Infer configurations, inputs, or device placements automatically to reduce user effort. Use context managers or hooks to automate resource release and prevent state leakage. Fail early with clear, actionable error messages that guide users to solutions and suggest alternatives. Start with simple interfaces for common use cases and expose advanced options only as needed. Design APIs and tools for easy experimentation in interactive environments like Jupyter notebooks, supporting quick checks and prototyping. Make it easy to save, load, version, and share models, adapters, datasets, and metrics via the Hugging Face Hub. Provide documented patterns and base classes for users to add custom components, models, or tasks. Maintain an accessible, documented workflow to encourage community contributions and feedback. Enable tracking of model, dataset, and code origins, and give proper credit to creators through metadata and model cards. Assume diverse environments, varying data, and unexpected model architectures, and design to handle them. Prioritize loose coupling and adaptable interactions to support future evolution and new technologies. Adapt to missing dependencies or unexpected inputs with warnings or sensible fallbacks instead of crashing. Implement robust logging with configurable levels to aid debugging and understand system behavior. Optimize default configurations for performance and memory efficiency in common tasks. Support efficient execution across CPU, GPU, TPUs, and custom accelerators with easy device management tools. Provide tools or patterns, like accelerate or DeepSpeed, to enable distributed training and inference for large models. Optimize for the most frequent user tasks and hardware configurations while supporting advanced scenarios. Use techniques like quantization and pruning to reduce computational cost and carbon footprint. Release software early, gather community feedback, and refine based on real-world usage. Ensure components are testable in isolation and in integration, maintaining high test coverage. Manage and communicate versions for models, datasets, and libraries clearly, using semantic versioning. Use GitHub issues, forums, and surveys to guide development priorities based on community feedback. Include a detailed model card with every model on the Hub, covering architecture, training data, uses, limitations, biases, and evaluation results. Provide standardized evaluation scripts, datasets, and metrics for reproducible model performance verification. Establish review processes or gated access for potentially impactful models to ensure responsible release. Structure models for easy fine-tuning on downstream tasks and custom datasets to support transfer learning. Include tools and processes to detect and address biases in data and models to promote fairness. Develop tools for model interpretability, like attention visualization or feature importance, to build trust and aid debugging. Provide configurable hooks or default implementations for content filtering and safety checks, especially for generative models. Implement safeguards against model tampering and unauthorized access, and use privacy-preserving techniques like federated learning where applicable.
